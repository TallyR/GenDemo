                How does Approov work?
                How Approov Mobile Security protects your mobile apps and APIs
                Approov Mobile Security is a run-time application self protection (RASP) technology, enabling software attestation, and designed specifically for use within mobile applications running on iOS and Android. Approov creates a trusted environment to ensure that the mobile app connecting through an API is a genuine, untampered instance, fraudulent transactions, malicious scripts, and bot attacks are blocked at the source.
                <br />
                <br />
                The Approov service employs a challenge-response cryptographic protocol to verify the authenticity of a connecting client application. This approach differs fundamentally from other solutions because it does not rely on any secret embedded within the app. Instead, it dynamically assesses the integrity of the app to determine its nature rather than what it possesses as a static secret. Approov is designed to authenticate individual app instances, not users.
                The mobile app registration process involves using the Approov CLI tool to analyze and create a unique signature for the app, adding it to the Approov cloud service. This unique signature, or "DNA," is used to recognize the app as official without storing its code. Before each API request made by the app, the Approov SDK is called, and if no cached token is available, an integrity assessment process is initiated. This process involves the SDK and Approov cloud service working together to verify that the app and its runtime environment are legitimate and free from malicious activity. The SDK gathers the material used for the assessment and the cloud service makes a decision based on your security policy criteria, issuing a valid cryptographically signed Approov token if criteria are met. The token is cached by the SDK for up to 5 minutes and automatically refreshed before expiry or when the app’s runtime environment changes. Communication is securely pinned to prevent interception.
                On the API backend, the validity of Approov tokens is checked to ensure requests are from an official, unmodified app and not from scripts, bots, or compromised environments. Since the signing key is not in the app, attackers cannot reverse engineer it to create their own signed tokens. Requests failing the token check are likely from unauthorized sources, and you can configure your backend to block them.
                <br />
                <br />
                How does Approov Compare with Mobile App Hardening Solutions?
                When considering the comparison between Approov Mobile Security and traditional mobile app hardening solutions, it's important to recognize that each of these security measures serves distinct purposes and can potentially work in tandem to enhance the overall security of your mobile applications and backend infrastructure.
                <br />
                <br />
                Approov, at its core, is purpose-built to safeguard the APIs that mobile apps rely on. Its primary focus is on ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the communication between mobile applications and the backend servers. This means that Approov places a strong emphasis on preventing API abuse, unauthorized access, and ensuring that only genuine, unmodified mobile apps can interact with your backend services.
                <br />
                <br />
                On the other hand, app hardening solutions are primarily designed to protect the mobile application itself. These solutions employ various techniques like code obfuscation, encryption, and anti-tampering measures to make it more difficult for malicious actors to reverse engineer or manipulate the mobile app. They enhance the app's resistance against cracking, data extraction, and other app-level attacks.
                <br />
                <br />
                The choice between Approov and app hardening solutions depends on several factors, including the specific threats you need to guard against and the nature of the data your mobile app handles.
                <br />
                <br />
                Approov provides robust security measures to protect mobile apps and their associated APIs, ensuring the authenticity of the apps, the safety of the client device, and the integrity of connections to backend services.
                <br />
                <br />
                Here are the six ways in which Approov secures mobile apps:
                <br />
                <br />
                1. App Attestation: Approov ensures that only genuine and authentic apps can access your backend services. It effectively prevents bots, as well as tampered or repackaged apps from gaining access. The system employs a deterministic approach that minimizes false positives.
                <br />
                <br />
                2. Real Time Threat Intelligence: Approov provides immediate, real-time visibility into your deployed apps, the environments they operate in, and any threats being actively mitigated.
                <br />
                <br />
                3. Dynamic Certificate Pinning: This feature prevents Man-in-the-Middle attacks by securing connections to a fixed set of backend certificates that can be easily managed. It also offers over-the-air instant pin updates without service disruptions.
                <br />
                <br />
                4. Runtime Secrets Protection: Approov addresses the issue of hard-coded or stolen API keys by delivering secrets "just-in-time" to the app when needed for making API calls, but only after the app and its runtime environment have passed attestation. These secrets are dynamically managed and can be updated across all deployed apps without requiring app updates.
                <br />
                <br />
                5. API Security: Approov conducts continuous and thorough inspections of mobile apps and their host devices to guarantee authenticity when accessing backend APIs and services. API keys are granted only if the app is genuine and the environment is safe, thus preventing API abuse, credential stuffing, fake botnet registrations,and DDoS attacks.
                <br />
                <br />
                6. App Shielding: Approov identifies unsafe conditions on the client device, such as rooted or jailbroken devices, apps runningunder debuggers or emulators, or the presence of malicious frameworks. It validates the client environment and applies dynamic policies for fine-grained control.
                <br />

                How is the Approov SDK protected from attacks?
                <br />
                <br />
                Does the Approov cloud service authenticate the Approov SDK?
                <br />
                <br />
                The Approov SDK itself is built in accordance with the OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) as a guide for best practices. The Approov SDK utilizes the following tactics (and others):
                <br />
                <br />
                * Code obfuscation/hardening: The Approov SDK itself is extensively hardened, so the it's code is more difficult for an attacker to understand in terms of both structure and functionality.
                <br />
                <br />
                * Encryption: Strong encryption algorithms are used to protect all network traffic, data storage, and other sensitive information exchanged between the Approov SDK and the Approov cloud service, as well as communication to the backend APIs.
                <br />
                <br />
                * Anti-tampering measures: These measures are designed to detect and prevent tampering with the SDK's code and data. Anti-tampering measures extend beyond basic checksum validation, and include data integrity checks, and other binary protections.
                <br />
                <br />
                * Runtime protection: Approov monitors the app's behavior at runtime and detects and responds to suspicious activity. Runtime protection measures include detecting and preventing memory manipulation, detecting and blocking malicious code injection, and detecting and responding to unusual network activity.
                <br />
                <br />
                * Code minimization: Utilizing the Approov SDK reduces the perimeter needed to defend the application, and reduces the overall size and complexity of the attack surface. By minimizing the code, it becomes more difficult for an attacker to understand its structure and functionality.
                <br />
                <br />
                * Attestation of the SDK: As part of the app authentication process, the SDK is itself attested for authenticity before the rest of the app is attested for complete authenticity.
                <br />
                <br />
                By using a combination of these tactics, mobile app developers can make it more difficult for attackers to reverse engineer and tamper with their apps, improving the overall security and protecting sensitive data. The Approov SDK security used is much stronger than a static API key, that can easily be de-obfuscated through static analysis or at runtime.
                <br />
                <br />

                Why choose Approov for Mobile Security?
                <br />
                <br />
                What makes Approov better than other mobile application security software?
                <br />
                <br />
                Approov was built with the mobile application community in mind. It was not designed from a web application platform and later transitioned to mobile applications, but was envisioned and developed from the ground up for the mobile application environment.
                <br />
                <br />
                Approov provides a secure cloud and can deliver API keys or JWT tokens to mobile application at runtime can, which ultimately provides a much higher level of security. In this approach, the API keys are stored on a secure server, and the mobile application requests them at runtime. This way, the API keys are not hardcoded into the application and are not as easily accessible to attackers. Obfuscating APIs within the mobile application can provide some level of security by making it more difficult for attackers to discover and access the APIs. However, this approach is flawed, since the determined attackers can still reverse engineer the application and find the API endpoints.
                <br />
                <br />
                In summary, if security is a top priority, using Approov and its runtime secrets capability to move API keys and other secrets to a secure cloud and delivering them to the mobile application at runtime is generally the best option. Lastly, Approov also has a mode that does not require a constant Internet connection, enabling a broad variety of features such as keyless entry for automotive applications.
                <br />
                <br />

                From a liability perspective, when considering the security of our mobile solution, there is a lot of trust that we are placing on Approov’s solution to defend against attacks.

                <br />
                <br />
                A thoughtful opening line like this works better than a generic “How are you?” or talking about yourself first.
                <br />
                <br />

                4. Introduce yourself and your purpose
                <br />
                <br />

                Once you’ve hit the mark with your introduction, take a sentence or two to explain who you are and why you’re emailing. Be clear about your purpose so they immediately understand the context.
                <br />
                <br />
                For example:
                <br />
                <br />
                “My name is [your name] and I’m the [your position] at [your company]. I’m emailing because I saw that you recently partnered with [relevant company] on [relevant project].”
                <br />
                <br />
                The key is briefly introducing yourself while quickly pivoting to their needs. So, don’t spend multiple paragraphs boasting about yourself.
                <br />
                <br />

                5. Sympathize with their pain point
                <br />
                <br />

                After introducing yourself and the purpose of your email, immediately demonstrate that you understand their challenges & sympathize with their pain points. This will help to build rapport and show that you get their needs.
                <br />
                <br />
                Ideally, you should mention a specific pain point or challenge that you noticed while researching the prospect and explain how you can help resolve it.
                <br />
                <br />
                For example:
                <br />
                <br />
                “As a fellow marketer, I know how tough it can be figuring out which marketing automation platform makes sense with a limited budget. That’s actually why I’m reaching out…”
                <br />
                <br />
                By relating to their problems like this, you can come across like a partner and not just another salesperson.
                <br />
                <br />

                6. Add your unique value proposition (USP)
                <br />
                <br />
                In a cold email, you only have a few seconds to pique the reader’s interest. This is where your value proposition comes into play. Adding value proposition means swiftly communicating your offerings to your target audience.
                <br />
                <br />
                A well-crafted value proposition shows that you understand the recipient’s wants or concerns and how your offering may effectively address them. By emphasizing what makes your offer distinctive, you demonstrate to the recipient why they should choose your solution over others in the market.
                <br />
                <br />
                This relevance makes your email more appealing, boosting the likelihood that they will read on. When your value proposition matches their needs, it forges a bond that further drives them to interact with your email.
                <br />
                <br />
                Example:
                <br />
                <br />
                “We understand that a team like yours has excellent abilities but is frequently constrained by time and resources when it comes to increasing outbound lead creation. Our application can assist you in automating the mailing process, allowing your team members to focus on what they do best: closing deals.”
                <br />
                <br />

                7. Include a clear & direct call-to-action (CTA)
                <br />
                <br />
                Imagine this: Your recipient has read your mail and is impressed by your product but doesn’t know what to do next. This might sound strange, but this is the sad reality of most cold email campaigns.
                <br />
                <br />
                You can have the best email copy and subject line in the world, but no one will take the next step without a compelling call to action.
                <br />
                <br />

                Being direct with what you want them to do makes it easy for them to take action.
                <br />
                <br />
                However, make sure you are not being overly salesy, otherwise, you risk annoying your prospects who are not yet ready to buy.
                <br />
                <br />

                8. Close your email with appreciation
                <br />
                <br />
                Showing gratitude takes you a long way. Ending your email with appreciation is a pleasant way to express gratitude while also leaving a great impression on the recipient.
                <br />
                <br />
                So, to earn some brownie points, adopt the age-old practice of being humble in concluding your emails.
                <br />
                <br />
                Let us share a few examples:
                <br />
                <br />
                * “Thank You for your time and consideration.”
                <br />
                <br />
                * “I want to express my gratitude for your support.”
                <br />
                <br />
                * “I look forward to your continued support and thank you in advance.”
                <br />
                <br />

                9. Don’t forget your email signature
                <br />
                <br />
                Finally, be sure to include a professional email signature with your name, title, company, phone number, and email address. This gives them the details they need to contact you easily.
                <br />
                <br />
                A professional email signature is essential since it acts as a virtual business card and leaves a pictorial impression in the recipient’s head. Using the company’s name, logo, and corporate colors helps reinforce brand recognition.
                <br />
                <br />
                It facilitates simple communication and establishes trust with potential customers by offering important contact information and social media links. This increases response rates and trust, establishing fruitful business relationships.
                <br />
                <br />


                10. Demonstrate your Authority
                <br />
                <br />
                * When you reach out to someone you don’t know, you must show them who you are and why they should care about what you have to say. You’ve probably researched them, but they know nothing about you. Hence, developing confidence and trust is essential.
                <br />
                <br />
                * One good strategy to do this is finding common ground. Mentioning your mutual connections will provide powerful social proof that you are not simply another faceless stranger. It fills the gap right away.
                <br />
                <br />
                * If you don’t have major contacts or authority, look for uncommon connections or similar interests that foster a sense of connection. Even on a personal level, belonging to the same group can foster strong human connections.
                <br />
                <br />
                * Remember, those unexpected and rare similarities truly bond us with others. The goal is to go from a “stranger” to someone they feel they can relate to and be comfortable with.
                <br />
                <br />

                11. Don’t being too salesy or aggressive
                <br />
                <br />
                Everyone has encountered an overly enthusiastic salesperson who seems more focused on selling us something than understanding our requirements. It’s annoying.
                <br />
                <br />
                But when writing a cold email, building relationships and providing value to the recipients should be the main priorities rather than using forceful sales tactics and aggressive pitches. A positive and optimistic tone should run through your email, making a great first impression.
                <br />
                <br />
                Your email becomes more interesting and enticing when you care about the receiver and their needs. It’s all about building a relationship and demonstrating that you’re here to contribute, not just to make a quick sale.
                <br />
                <br />


                Here is the data about the person:
                <br />
                <br />

                $[personalData]
                <br />
                <br />

                The potential customer’s company information:
                <br />
                <br />

                $[companyData]
                <br />
                <br />

                Keep it short and to the point: Cold emails should be concise and easy to read. Personalize the email: Address the recipient by name and use a friendly, conversational tone. Avoid sounding too formal or robotic.
                <br />
                <br />

                Make this email from 50 to 125 words. DO NOT GO OVER 200 words!
                <br />
                <br />

                Do not be salesy, be casual and eye-catching.
                <br />
                <br />

            </p>

        </div>
    );
}
